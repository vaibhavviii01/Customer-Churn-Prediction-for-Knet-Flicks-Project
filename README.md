#Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) Analysis - Data Science for Product Managers

This project estimates Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) using Python by analyzing transaction data. It involves data cleaning, EDA cohort-based CLV calculation, and regression modeling to identify sales drivers. The insights help optimize marketing spend, improve retention strategies, &amp; enhance profitability through data-driven decisions. 

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) is a crucial metric in marketing that estimates the total revenue a business can expect from a single customer over their lifetime. In this project, I performed the following tasks:

--> Data Understanding & Cleaning

Loaded and explored the dataset (customer_sales.csv).
Identified missing values, outliers, and anomalies.
Generated key statistics and visualizations.

--> Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Detected outliers and anomalies using statistical methods and visualizations.
Examined the effect of discounts on sales and profit.
Identified key factors influencing sales using regression analysis.

--> CLV Calculation

Assigned customers to acquisition cohorts based on their first purchase date.
Calculated cumulative transaction amounts for each cohort.
Computed the number of new customers acquired each year.
Estimated Historic CLV for different cohorts.
Created visualizations to interpret CLV trends.

--> Business Insights & Interpretation

Analyzed spending patterns of different customer groups.
Derived actionable insights for customer retention and acquisition strategies.

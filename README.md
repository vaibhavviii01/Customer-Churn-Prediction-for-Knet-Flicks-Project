Customer Churn Prediction and Clustering - Knet-Flicks | Data Science for Product Managers

This project focuses on analyzing customer churn for Knet-Flicks, a video streaming and internet service provider. The dataset includes customer account details, service subscriptions, and past interactions. The goal is to explore customer segmentation, identify key factors driving churn, and build predictive models to assess churn risk.

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
Through exploratory data analysis (EDA), clustering, and supervised learning techniques, we gain insights into customer behavior and suggest strategies to reduce churn. Understanding churn drivers helps Knet-Flicks retain valuable customers and optimize their marketing strategies.

ðŸ“ŒTechnologies Used

 - Python
 - Jupyter Notebook
 â€“ Data processing and analysis: Pandas, NumPy
 â€“ Data visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
 â€“ Machine learning models (clustering, classification): Scikit-learn
 â€“ Supervised learning models: XGBoost / Random Forest / Logistic Regression 
 â€“ Unsupervised learning for customer segmentation: K-Means / Hierarchical Clustering 
 
ðŸ“ŒProject Insights

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

- Handled missing values and outliers.
- Feature engineering, including encoding categorical variables and normalizing numeric values.
- Visualized customer demographics and usage patterns.

ðŸ“ŒCustomer Segmentation (Clustering):

- Applied K-Means clustering to segment customers based on account and service attributes.
- Identified distinct groups with varying churn risks and service preferences.
- Determined optimal clusters using the elbow method and silhouette score.

ðŸ“ŒChurn Prediction (Supervised Learning):

- Built two predictive models using different supervised learning techniques.
- Identified the top 5 features influencing churn.
- Compared model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
  
ðŸ“ŒKey Findings:

Customers on month-to-month contracts are more likely to churn.
Lack of additional services (security, backups) correlates with higher churn rates.
High churn risk segments have lower tenure and higher extra data charges.
Recommendations include loyalty discounts, improved customer support, and personalized retention offers.
